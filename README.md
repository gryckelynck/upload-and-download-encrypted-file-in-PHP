# upload-and-download-encrypted-file-in-PHP

First you have to create two folders names upload and download resp.
two folders should be created in perticular server folder 
(means in wampp server folder should be in www folder and in xampp server it should be in htdocs folder).
open the browser and type localhost/folder name/ index.php
it will open the html page where you can select and upload the file. 
files are store in encrypted format in upload folder.
